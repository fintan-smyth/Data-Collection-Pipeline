Unemployed, and with no family, he hopes to find a place to commit seppuku\u2014and a worthy second to deliver the coup de gr\u00e2ce in his suicide ritual.

What follows is a pair of interlocking stories which lay bare the difference between honor and respect, and promises to examine the legendary foundations of the Samurai code.
