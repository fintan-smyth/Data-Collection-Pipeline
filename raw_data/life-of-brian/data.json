When he\u2019s not dodging his followers or being scolded by his shrill mother, the hapless Brian has to contend with the pompous Pontius Pilate and acronym-obsessed members of a separatist movement. Rife with Monty Python\u2019s signature absurdity, the tale finds Brian\u2019s life paralleling Biblical lore, albeit with many more laughs.", "Poster": "https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/sm/upload/ui/oc/sh/aa/wEgm6iVOD4afMlEo1VGi3Yz0cmd-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=84c2b92572"}
