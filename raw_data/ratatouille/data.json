When fate places Remy in the sewers of Paris, he finds himself ideally situated beneath a restaurant made famous by his culinary hero, Auguste Gusteau. Despite the apparent dangers of being an unlikely - and certainly unwanted - visitor in the kitchen of a fine French restaurant, Remy\u2019s passion for cooking soon sets into motion a hilarious and exciting rat race that turns the culinary world of Paris upside down.
