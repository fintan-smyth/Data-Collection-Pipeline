Max Cady is a tattooed, cigar-smoking, bible-quoting, psychotic rapist. What do they have in common? Fourteen years ago, Sam was a public defender assigned to Max Cady\u2019s rape trial, and he made a serious error: he hid a document from his illiterate client that could have gotten him acquitted. Now, the cagey, bibliophile Cady has been released, and he intends to teach Sam Bowden and his family a thing or two about loss.", "Poster": "https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/sm/upload/wc/jb/p9/ds/cape-fear-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=6e148eef07"}
