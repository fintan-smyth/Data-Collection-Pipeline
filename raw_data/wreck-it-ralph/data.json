Wanting to prove he can be a good guy and not just a villain, Ralph escapes his game and lands in Hero\u2019s Duty, a first-person shooter where he helps the game\u2019s hero battle against alien invaders. He later enters Sugar Rush, a kart racing game set on tracks made of candies, cookies and other sweets. There, Ralph meets Vanellope von Schweetz who has learned that her game is faced with a dire threat that could affect the entire arcade, and one that Ralph may have inadvertently started.
